== Overview ==

Child Theme Configurator PRO makes it easy to make your plugins exactly match your theme.

You can create custom plugin styles from any plugin, even if it uses multiple stylesheets. Child Theme Configurator PRO lets you choose from your installed plugins and save the results in your Child Theme directory.

== Getting Started ==

Read the instructions! If you are not familiar with our Child Theme Configurator, you will want to explore the documentation and videos first. http://www.childthemeconfigurator.com/documentation/

Now that you are an expert with the Child Theme Configurator, select an existing Parent and Child Theme. 
IMPORTANT: Custom plugin styles are configured for a specific Child Theme, so you must create and select one first.

Your active Source CSS options now appear on the "Parent/Child" tab under the "Parse Plugin Stylesheets" toggle section.

Click "Generate Child Theme Files" and the plugin stylesheet can then be customized in exactly the same way as the Parent Theme stylesheet. If you need a refresher on using the Child Theme Configurator, read the instructions here.

== Update Key ==

Your license includes software updates when they are released. To configure WordPress to automatically alert you of available updates, enter your Update Key in the box under "Extended Settings". Your Update Key was sent with the confirmation email you received with the download link. (See screenshot-5.)
